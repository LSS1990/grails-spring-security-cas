To test the plugin, first run 'grails install' to package the plugin and copy to mavenLocal(). Update the plugin version in each app's build.gradle.

Unpack server.tar.gz. This is a trimmed-down Tomcat 8.0.26 configured to run on port 9090 and with no webapps. Copy the war into the webapps directory and rename to cas.war. It's a regular CAS war with one small tweak in WEB-INF/spring-configuration/ticketGrantingTicketCookieGenerator.xml to change p:cookieSecure to "false" to allow non-ssl access to simplify testing.

Run the CAS server with bin/startup.sh and the two test apps with "grails run-app".

The test script is simple:
	navigate to either app's secure controller (http://localhost:8081/secure/admins or http://localhost:8082/secure/admins) and login with admin/admin
	navigate to the other server's secure controller and you should already be authenticated

The CAS server is configured to authenticate a user if the password matches the username; the test apps create an 'admin' user in BootStrap.
